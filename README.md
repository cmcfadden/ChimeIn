ChimeIn
=======

ChimeIn is a cloud-based clicker application, developed by the (College of Liberal Arts)[http://www.cla.umn.edu] at the University of Minnesota.

The goals of ChimeIn are to provide both multiple-choice and full-text response clicker-style feedback without requiring dedicated hardware.  ChimeIn leverages laptops, smartphones and "dumbphones" to aggregate responses.

A production instance is visible at (https://chimein.cla.umn.edu/)[https://chimein.cla.umn.edu/].  We're working to develop a complete open source release, and would be interested in working with interested parties.
